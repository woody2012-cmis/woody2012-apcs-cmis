//a. What is the output of the compareTo() method telling us? 
// whether StringA.compareTo(StringB)
//how many letters that String B comes after or before String A, based on the first letter.
//b. Compare to colleges that have the same first letter and a different second letter. What does compareTo() do in this case?
//compareTo() will ignore the first letter that are similar and then compare the second letters that are different.
